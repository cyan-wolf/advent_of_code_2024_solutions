# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

## Description
This project has the source code for the solutions to the various problems in [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). 
Each problem is meant to be solved using a different programming language.
**Note**: Most of the source code isn't directly runnable, as many languages such as Java or C# require extra project files to run.

## Purpose
For learning new programming languages!
